AI-Driven Supervision Compliance Tracker - User Journey

🎯 Overview

This document outlines the user journey for the AI-Driven Supervision Compliance Tracker, detailing how BCBAs (Board Certified Behavior Analysts) interact with the system to track RBT (Registered Behavior Technician) supervision compliance efficiently.

👥 User Roles

BCBA (Primary User) - Uses the system to track RBT supervision compliance.

RBT (Secondary User) - Views personal supervision hour logs.

Clinic Administrator (Optional) - Monitors compliance across all staff.

📌 User Journey: BCBA Perspective

1️⃣ Login & Dashboard Overview

The BCBA logs in to the compliance tracker.

They are taken to the dashboard, which provides:

📊 Supervision summary (total hours logged, compliance status, breakdown by direct vs. indirect supervision)

⚠️ Alerts for supervision risks (missing hours, overdue compliance, group vs. individual session tracking)

📅 Upcoming supervision sessions (face-to-face vs. remote sessions)

2️⃣ Supervision Tracking & Compliance Check

The BCBA selects an RBT from their caseload.

The system displays:

Supervision hours breakdown (direct vs. indirect, group vs. individual, face-to-face vs. remote supervision)

BACB compliance check (Does this RBT meet the 5% supervision requirement?)

Risk analysis (Is this RBT trending toward non-compliance based on session types?)

3️⃣ AI-Generated Risk Alerts & Recommendations

If an RBT is at risk of non-compliance, the AI provides:

🚨 Red Alert - Critical: RBT supervision is below BACB compliance requirements.

⚠️ Yellow Warning - At Risk: RBT is trending toward non-compliance in a specific area (e.g., insufficient face-to-face supervision).

✅ Green Status - Fully Compliant.

The system suggests corrective actions, such as:

“Schedule an additional face-to-face supervision session this week.”

“Ensure the next session is individual supervision to meet the BACB requirement.”

“Increase direct supervision percentage to align with BACB compliance.”

4️⃣ Supervision Report Generation

The BCBA clicks ‘Generate Report’ to create a BACB-compliant supervision log.

The system auto-generates:

📄 Supervision history summary

📊 Compliance trends over time (group vs. individual, direct vs. indirect, face-to-face vs. remote)

✅ BCBA certification-ready documentation

5️⃣ Notifications & Continuous Monitoring

The system continuously monitors supervision compliance across different session types.

BCBA receives weekly/monthly reports categorized by direct vs. indirect, face-to-face vs. remote, and group vs. individual supervision.

AI sends automated reminders for supervision deadlines and at-risk categories.

📌 User Journey: RBT Perspective

1️⃣ Viewing Supervision Logs

RBT logs in and accesses their personal supervision history.

They can see:

📅 Completed & upcoming supervision sessions categorized by session type.

✅ Compliance status (highlighting gaps in direct, individual, or face-to-face supervision).

2️⃣ Receiving Compliance Feedback

AI-generated messages inform the RBT of:

Supervision requirements met or missing.

Upcoming deadlines.

Suggested actions (e.g., “Confirm your next face-to-face supervision session with your BCBA”).

📌 User Journey: Clinic Administrator (Optional)

1️⃣ Monitoring Compliance for All RBTs

Administrators view clinic-wide compliance dashboards.

They can filter by:

✅ Compliant RBTs.

⚠️ At-risk RBTs (lacking face-to-face or direct supervision hours).

🚨 Non-compliant RBTs.

2️⃣ Generating Compliance Reports

Clinic-wide supervision audits can be generated.

Reports can be exported for regulatory reviews.

🛡️ Ethical Considerations & Compliance Alignment

This system is designed to align with the BACB Ethics Code by ensuring:

✅ Supervision meets BACB standards (5% requirement, face-to-face, direct/indirect tracking).

✅ BCBAs retain full decision-making authority—AI provides recommendations but does not override human judgment.

✅ Transparency in compliance monitoring—supervision reports are always accessible to BCBAs and RBTs.

✅ Confidentiality & Security—if integrated with real data, the system will ensure compliance with HIPAA and data protection best practices.

🔜 Next Steps

🔹 Define AI logic & risk detection rules for each supervision type.

🔹 Create UI wireframes for the dashboard with supervision type breakdowns.

🚀 This journey ensures that BCBA supervision is proactive, automated, and always BACB-compliant!
