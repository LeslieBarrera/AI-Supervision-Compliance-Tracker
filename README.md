# AI-Driven Supervision Compliance Tracker

## 📌 Project Overview

The AI-Driven Supervision Compliance Tracker is designed to help BCBAs (Board Certified Behavior Analysts) ensure RBT (Registered Behavior Technician) supervision compliance with BACB (Behavior Analyst Certification Board) regulations.

This tool automates supervision tracking, flags compliance risks, and provides proactive alerts to prevent non-compliance before it happens.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

BCBAs manually track RBT supervision hours to meet BACB compliance requirements. However:

    - Supervision tracking is time-consuming and prone to human error.

    - Non-compliance can lead to penalties or loss of certification.

    - No AI-driven solutions exist that proactively predict and prevent compliance failures.

## 🚀 Solution

An AI-powered tracker that:
    ✅ Automates supervision hour tracking (direct, indirect, individual, group)
    ✅ Flags compliance risks (missing hours, incorrect ratios, overdue supervision)
    ✅ Predicts future gaps and sends alerts before issues arise
    ✅ Provides a BCBA dashboard for real-time monitoring

## 👥 Target Users

    - BCBAs – Need supervision tracking & compliance alerts

    - Clinic Owners/Directors – Ensure RBTs meet BACB guidelines

    - RBTs – Track their own supervision hours & progress

## 🛠️ Key Features (MVP)

    📊 Supervision Hour Tracker – Logs direct/indirect supervision automatically

    🚦 BACB Compliance Checker – Flags supervision risks & alerts BCBAs

    ⚠️ Risk Alert System – AI predicts compliance gaps before they happen

    📌 Dashboard for BCBAs – Real-time supervision & compliance status

    🏗️ Future Enhancements

    🔮 Predictive AI Modeling – Forecasts compliance risks using past data

    📜 Automated Documentation – Generates BACB-compliant supervision logs

    🔗 Integration with ABA Software – Syncs with CentralReach, Catalyst, etc.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack (Proposed)

    - Backend: Python (Flask/FastAPI)

    - AI Engine: NLP & Predictive Analytics

    - Database: PostgreSQL/Firebase

    - Frontend: Streamlit / React (Optional for MVP)
